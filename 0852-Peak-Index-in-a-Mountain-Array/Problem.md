# 0852. Peak Index in a Mountain Array

## Description

You are given an integer **mountain** array `arr` of length `n` where the values increase to a **peak element** and then decrease.

Return the index of the peak element.

Your task is to solve it in `O(log(n))` time complexity.

## Example

**Input:**  
arr = [0,1,0]
<br>
**Output:**
<br>
1

## Constraints

- `3 <= arr.length <= 10^5`
- `0 <= arr[i] <= 10^6`
- `arr` is **guaranteed** to be a mountain array.

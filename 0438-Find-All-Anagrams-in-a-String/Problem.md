# 0438. Find All Anagrams in a String

## Description

Given two strings `s` and `p`, return an array of all the start indices of `p`'s **anagrams** in `s`. You may return the answer in **any order**.

## Example

**Input:**  
s = "cbaebabacd", p = "abc"
<br>
**Output:**
<br>
[0,6]
<br>
**Explanation:**
<br>
The substring with start index = 0 is "cba", which is an anagram of "abc".
<br>
The substring with start index = 6 is "bac", which is an anagram of "abc".

## Constraints

- `1 <= s.length, p.length <= 3 * 10^4`
- `s` and `p` consist of lowercase English letters.

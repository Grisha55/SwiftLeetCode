/*
ðŸ§  Simple explanation:
1. First we count how many times each letter appears in p.
2. Then we slide over the string s with a window of length p.count.
3. In each window we count the letters and compare them with what was in p.
4. If it matches, it's an anagram, we save the index of the beginning of the window.

ðŸ“Œ Things to remember:
    - Comparing two dictionaries (window == pCount) works because Swift compares key/value pairs.
    - This is an efficient algorithm because instead of recalculating each time, we update the window by adding/removing characters one at a time.

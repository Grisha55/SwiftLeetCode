# 0287. Find the Duplicate Number

## Description

Given an array of integers `nums` containing `n + 1` integers where each integer is in the range `[1, n]` inclusive.

There is only **one repeated number** in `nums`, return this repeated number.

You must solve the problem **without** modifying the array `nums` and using only constant extra space.

## Example

**Input:**  
nums = [1,3,4,2,2]
<br>
**Output:**
<br>
2

## Constraints

- `1 <= n <= 10^5`
- `nums.length == n + 1`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= n`
- All the integers in `nums` appear only **once** except for **precisely one integer** which appears **two or more** times.

**Follow up:**

How can we prove that at least one duplicate number must exist in `nums`?
Can you solve the problem in linear runtime complexity?

/*
üß† Problem statement (in simple terms):
You are given a list of box weights and a number of days. You need to determine the minimum carrying capacity of a ship to transport all the boxes in a given number of days, where:
    - the boxes must be transported in the order they are given (the order cannot be changed);
    - you can send several boxes per day until the total weight exceeds the carrying capacity;
    - then you need to wait for the next day.


üß© Solution idea:
We use binary search for the answer:
    1. The minimum possible carrying capacity is the maximum weight of one box.
    2. The maximum possible is the sum of all the weights (if everything is in 1 day).
    3. We use binary search: we are looking for the smallest possible carrying capacity at which everything can be transported in days days.
    4. The isValid function checks whether a ship with a given cargo capacity can complete the mission in the required number of days.


üîç Example:
let weights = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
let days = 5
The solution is to find the smallest weight capacity that will allow us to ship all the boxes in 5 days. The answer is 15.

üìä Complexity:
Time: O(n * log(sum(weights))), where n is the number of boxes. For each binary search iteration (log), we go through all the boxes.

Memory: O(1) ‚Äî no additional memory is used except for variables.

# 🔢 Problem #83: Remove Duplicates from Sorted List

## 📝 Description

Given the `head` of a sorted linked list, delete all duplicates such that each element appears only once. Return the linked list **sorted** as well.

## 📚 Examples

**Input**: head = [1,1,2]
<br>
**Output**: [1,2]

## 💡 Constraints

- The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 300]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
- The list is guaranteed to be **sorted** in ascending order.

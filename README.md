# SwiftLeetCode
This repository contains my Swift solutions for various LeetCode problems.

# 🚀 Swift LeetCode Solutions
A personal collection of LeetCode problems solved in Swift.  
This repo is part of my journey to master data structures, algorithms, and technical interviews.

---

## 📁 Repository Structure
Each solution is placed in a folder named by its problem number and title:
```
├── 0001-Two-Sum/
│ └── Solution.swift
├── 0020-Valid-Parentheses/
│ └── Solution.swift
├── 0053-Maximum-Subarray/
│ └── Solution.swift
```

Inside each folder:
- `Solution.swift`: Swift code with inline comments.
- `README.md` (optional): Short problem description and approach.

---

## 🎯 Goal
- Build strong problem-solving skills in Swift  
- Prepare for interviews (FAANG, startups, etc.)  
- Create a structured archive of solutions

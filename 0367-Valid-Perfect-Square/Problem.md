# 0367. Valid Perfect Square

## Description

Given a positive integer num, return `true` if `num` is a perfect square or `false` otherwise.

A **perfect square** is an integer that is the square of an integer. In other words, it is the product of some integer with itself.

You must not use any built-in library function, such as `sqrt`.

## Example

**Input:**  
num = 16
<br>
**Output:**
<br>
true
<br>
**Explanation:**
<br>
We return true because 4 * 4 = 16 and 4 is an integer.

## Constraints

- `1 <= num <= 2^31 - 1`

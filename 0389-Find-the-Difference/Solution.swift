/*
üß† Simple explanation:

What does the ^ (XOR) operator do?
XOR is a bitwise operation that has an interesting property:

A B A ^ B
0 0 0
1 0 1
0 1 1
1 1 0

If two numbers are the same, the result is 0. If they are different, the result is 1.

How does this help?
If we XOR all characters from s and t, then:
    - identical characters will "destroy" each other (A ^ A = 0)
    - only the extra character will remain, because it has no pair

üîç Step-by-step example:
s = "abcd"
t = "abcde"

In Unicode:
    a = 97
    b = 98
    c = 99
    d = 100
    e = 101

Result:
XOR all characters: 97 ^ 98 ^ 99 ^ 100 ^ 97 ^ 98 ^ 99 ^ 100 ^ 101 = 101
This is 'e'.

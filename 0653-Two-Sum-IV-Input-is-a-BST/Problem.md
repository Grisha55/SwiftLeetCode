# 0653. Two Sum IV - Input is a BST

## Description

Given the root of a binary search tree and an integer k, return true if there exist two elements in the BST such that their sum is equal to k, or false otherwise.

## Example

**Input:**
root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7], k = 9
<br>
**Output:**
<br>
true
<br>

## Constraints

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 104]`.
- `-10^4 <= Node.val <= 10^4`
- `root` is guaranteed to be a valid binary search tree.
- `-10^5 <= k <= 10^5`

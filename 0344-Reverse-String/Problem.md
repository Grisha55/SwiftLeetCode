# 0344. Reverse String

## Description

Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters `s`.

You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with `O(1)` extra memory.

## Example

**Input:**  
s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]
<br>
**Output:**
<br>
["o","l","l","e","h"]

## Constraints

- `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`
- `s[i]` is a printable ascii character.

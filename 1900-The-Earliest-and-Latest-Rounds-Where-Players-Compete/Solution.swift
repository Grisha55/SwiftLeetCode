 # Explanation of Earliest and Latest Rounds Solution

 ## Problem Overview
 This solution determines when two specific players will face each other in a single-elimination tournament where:
 - Players are initially ordered from 1 to n
 - In each round, players compete against their mirror position (1st vs last, 2nd vs 2nd-last, etc.)
 - The better players always win until they meet each other
 - We need to find both the earliest and latest possible round they could meet

 ## Key Concepts

 ### Tournament Structure
 1. **Initial Setup**: Players are lined up in order 1 through n
 2. **Pairing Mechanism**:
    - Each round pairs i-th player from start with i-th player from end
    - Middle player gets a bye if odd number of players remain
 3. **Winners Advancement**: Winners maintain their original relative ordering

 ### Solution Approach
 1. **Base Cases Handling**:
    - Immediate return if players are already paired in first round
    - Special handling for small tournaments (3-4 players)

 2. **Position Normalization**:
    - Mirror positions when one player is closer to an end than the other
    - Simplifies subsequent calculations

 3. **Recursive Calculation**:
    - **First Half Scenario**: Both players in first half of bracket
    - **Cross-Middle Scenario**: Players on opposite sides of middle
    - Evaluates all possible match outcomes that could delay or accelerate their meeting

 ## Algorithm Details

 ### For Earliest Round
 1. Players meet as soon as they become mirror positions
 2. Progressively halves the tournament size each round
 3. Tracks when they first become paired

 ### For Latest Round
 1. Maximizes the distance between players each round
 2. Positions them at opposite ends of the bracket when possible
 3. Continues until they must face each other

 ## Complexity Analysis
 - **Time**: O(log n) best case, but potentially higher due to recursive branching
 - **Space**: O(log n) for recursion stack depth

 ## Edge Cases Handled
 - Immediate first-round matches
 - Small tournaments (n â‰¤ 4)
 - Players initially near tournament boundaries
 - Odd/even player counts

 This approach efficiently explores the tournament structure while accounting for all possible match outcome variations that affect when the two players meet.

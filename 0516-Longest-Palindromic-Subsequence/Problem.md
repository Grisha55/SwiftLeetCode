# 0516. Longest Palindromic Subsequence

## Description

Given a string `s`, find the longest palindromic **subsequence**'s length in `s`.

A **subsequence** is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

## Example

**Input:**  
Input: s = "bbbab"
<br>
**Output:**
<br>
4
<br>
**Explanation:**
<br>
One possible longest palindromic subsequence is "bbbb".

## Constraints

- `1 <= s.length <= 1000`
- `s` consists only of lowercase English letters.

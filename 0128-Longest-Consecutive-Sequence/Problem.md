# 128. Longest Consecutive Sequence

## Description

Given an unsorted array of integers `nums`, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(n)` time.

## Example

**Input:**  
<br>
nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]
<br>
**Output:**
<br>
4
<br>
**Explanation:**
<br>
The longest consecutive elements sequence is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. Therefore its length is 4.

## Constraints

- `0 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`

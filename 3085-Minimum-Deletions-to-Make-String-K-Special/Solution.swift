/*
ðŸ“˜ Problem statement â€” explanation in plain language:
You are given a string word and a number k.
k-special string is a string where the difference in frequencies of any two symbols does not exceed k.

For example, if k = 1, then the symbol 'a' can occur at most 1 more than 'b', 'c', etc.

ðŸ‘‰ Your task is to remove the minimum number of symbols to make the string k-special.



ðŸ§  Simple solution idea:
1. Let's count the frequencies of all symbols in the string.
2. We'll go through all possible target frequencies t from 1 to the maximum frequency:
    - We'll try to make sure that all symbols occur with frequencies from t to t + k.
    - If the symbol frequency is higher, we'll remove the extra one.
    - If it's less, we can ignore or completely remove the symbol.
3. Let's calculate how many symbols need to be removed so that all frequencies fit into [t, t + k].
4. Let's take the minimum among all possible options.

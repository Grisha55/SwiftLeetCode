# 0350. Intersection of Two Arrays II

## Description

Given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, return an array of their intersection. Each element in the result must appear as many times as it shows in both arrays and you may return the result in **any order**.

## Example

**Input:**  
nums1 = [1,2,2,1], nums2 = [2,2]
<br>
**Output:**
<br>
[2,2]

## Constraints

- `1 <= nums1.length, nums2.length <= 1000`
- `0 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 1000`

**Follow up:**

- What if the given array is already sorted? How would you optimize your algorithm?
- What if `nums1`'s size is small compared to `nums2`'s size? Which algorithm is better?
- What if elements of `nums2` are stored on disk, and the memory is limited such that you cannot load all elements into the memory at once?

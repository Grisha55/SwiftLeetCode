# 2099. Find Subsequence of Length K With the Largest Sum

## Description

You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. You want to find a **subsequence** of `nums` of length `k` that has the **largest** sum.

Return any such subsequence as an integer array of length `k`.

A **subsequence** is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

## Example

**Input:**  
nums = [2,1,3,3], k = 2
<br>
**Output:**
<br>
[3,3]
<br>
**Explanation:**
<br>
The subsequence has the largest sum of 3 + 3 = 6.

## Constraints

- `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`
- `-10^5 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`
- `1 <= k <= nums.length`

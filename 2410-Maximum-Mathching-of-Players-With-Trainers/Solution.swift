/*
Explanation:
1. Sorting the Arrays:
    - First, we sort both the players and trainers arrays. This allows us to use an efficient two-pointer technique.
    - Sorting helps us consider the smallest available players and trainers first, maximizing potential matches.
2. Two Pointers Technique:
    - We initialize two pointers (playerIndex and trainerIndex) at the start of each sorted array.
    - We also initialize a matches counter to keep track of successful pairings.
3. Matching Process:
    - We compare the current player's ability with the current trainer's capacity.
    - If the player's ability is â‰¤ the trainer's capacity, it's a valid match:
        - Increment the matches counter
        - Move both pointers forward (this player and trainer are now matched)
- If not valid, just move the trainer pointer forward (try next trainer for current player)

4. Termination:
    - The loop continues until we've processed all players or all trainers.
    - The final matches count represents the maximum possible pairings.

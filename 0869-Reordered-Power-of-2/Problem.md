# 0869. Reordered Power of 2

## Description

You are given an integer `n`. We reorder the digits in any order (including the original order) such that the leading digit is not zero.

Return `true` if and only if we can do this so that the resulting number is a power of two.

## Example

**Input:**  
n = 1
<br>
**Output:**
<br>
true
<br>

## Constraints

- `1 <= n <= 10^9`

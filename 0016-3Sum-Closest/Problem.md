# 0001. Two Sum

## Description

Given an integer array `nums` of length `n` and an integer `target`, find three integers in `nums` such that the sum is closest to `target`.

Return the sum of the three integers.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.

## Example

**Input:**  
nums = [-1,2,1,-4], target = 1
<br>
**Output:**
<br>
2
<br>
**Explanation:**
<br>
The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2).

## Constraints

- `3 <= nums.length <= 500`
- `-1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000`
- `-10^4 <= target <= 10^4`

# 🔢 Problem #76: Minimum Window Substring

## 📝 Description

Given two strings `s` and `t` of lengths `m` and `n` respectively, return the **minimum window** substring of `s` such that every character in `t` (**including duplicates**) is included in the window. If there is no such substring, return the empty string `""`.

The testcases will be generated such that the answer is **unique**.

## 📚 Examples

**Input**: s = "ADOBECODEBANC", t = "ABC"
<br>
**Output**: "BANC"

## 💡 Constraints

- `m == s.length`
- `n == t.length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 10^5`
- `s` and `t` consist of uppercase and lowercase English letters.

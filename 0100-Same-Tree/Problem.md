# 0100. Same Tree

## Description

Given the roots of two binary trees `p` and `q`, write a function to check if they are the same or not.

Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical, and the nodes have the same value.

## Example

**Input:**  
p = [1,2,3], q = [1,2,3]
<br>
**Output:**
<br>
true
<br>

## Constraints

- The number of nodes in both trees is in the range `[0, 100]`.
- `-10^4 <= Node.val <= 10^4`

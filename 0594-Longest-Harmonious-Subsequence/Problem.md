# 594. Longest Harmonious Subsequence

## Description

We define a harmonious array as an array where the **difference between its maximum and minimum value is exactly 1**.

Given an integer array `nums`, return the **length of its longest harmonious subsequence** among all possible subsequences.

A subsequence of an array is a sequence that can be derived from the array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

## Example

**Input:**
```swift
nums = [1, 3, 2, 2, 5, 2, 3, 7]

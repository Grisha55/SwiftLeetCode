/*
ðŸ§  Explained in simple words
In this solution we:
    1. Sort an array of numbers. This is important because the same and close values will go side by side.
    2. We use two pointers (double pointer or sliding window):
        - j is the beginning of the window;
        - i - the current element.
    3. As long as the difference between nums[i] and nums[j] is greater than 1 - we slide j to the right.
    4. If the difference is exactly 1, we have found a harmonious subsequence - update maxLen.
    5. Eventually we return the longest such subsequence.

This approach works for O(n log n) because of sorting.

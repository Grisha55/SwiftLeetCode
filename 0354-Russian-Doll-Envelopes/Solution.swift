ðŸ“¦ What does the maxEnvelopes function do?
You have an array of envelopes, and each of them is a pair of numbers [width, height]. You need to find the maximum number of envelopes that can be nested inside each other, like Russian dolls. You can nest only if both the width and the height of the next envelope are strictly greater than the previous one.


ðŸ§  How it works: a simple explanation
1. Sort all the envelopes:
    - First by width in ascending order.
    - If the width is the same, then by height in descending order (this is important to avoid nesting the same width).

2. From the resulting sorted list, take only the heights.
3. We use the algorithm for finding the longest increasing subsequence (LIS - Longest Increasing Subsequence), but we do this using binary search, which gives us good performance - O(n log n).

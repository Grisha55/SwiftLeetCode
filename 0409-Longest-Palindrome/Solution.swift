/*
ðŸ§  Simple explanation:
    1. We count how many times each letter appears in the string.
    2. If a letter appears an even number of times, all its occurrences can be used.
    3. If a letter appears an odd number of times, only an even number can be used (e.g. 4 out of 5 letters), and one letter can be left in the center of the palindrome.
    4. If there is at least one letter with an odd number, we can add one letter to the center of the palindrome.

âœ… Example:
For the string "abccccdd":

a: 1 time
b: 1 time
c: 4 times
d: 2 times

We can use:
c (4) + d (2) + a or b (1) = palindrome length 7 (e.g. "dccaccd").

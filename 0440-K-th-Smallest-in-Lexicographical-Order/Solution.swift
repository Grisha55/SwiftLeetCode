/*
ðŸ§  Simple explanation:
Think of the lexicographic order as a traversal of a prefix tree (Trie):
    - The root is 1, its children are: 10, 11, ..., 19
    - Then 2, 20, and so on...

The function goes down this tree step by step, counting how many numbers can be found starting from a certain prefix, and decides whether to move further in (multiplying by 10), or to move on to the next "brother" (increasing by 1).

# 1957. Delete Characters to Make Fancy String

## Description

A fancy string is a string where no three consecutive characters are equal.

Given a string `s`, delete the minimum possible number of characters from `s` to make it fancy.

Return the final string after the deletion. It can be shown that the answer will always be unique.

## Example

**Input:**  
s = "leeetcode"
<br>
**Output:**
<br>
"leetcode"
<br>
**Explanation:**
<br>
Remove an 'e' from the first group of 'e's to create "leetcode".
No three consecutive characters are equal, so return "leetcode".

## Constraints

- `1 <= s.length <= 10^5` 
- `s` consists only of lowercase English letters.

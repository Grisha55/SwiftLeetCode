üß† Problem statement (in simple terms):
You are given:
    - array days ‚Äî days you will be traveling;
    - array costs ‚Äî ticket prices:
        - costs[0]: ticket for 1 day;
        - costs[1]: ticket for 7 days;
        - costs[2]: ticket for 30 days.

You need to choose tickets to cover all days from the days array and spend as little money as possible.


üîç Solution idea:
We use dynamic programming:
    - dp[i] ‚Äî minimum ticket cost up to and including day i.
    - We go from 1 to 365 (since days are dates in a year).
    - If day i is not included in days, then the cost is the same as in i-1.
    - If it is included, we compare 3 options:
        - buy a ticket for 1 day;
        - buy a ticket for 7 days;
        - buy a ticket for 30 days;
    - We take the minimum of these three options.


‚úÖ Example:

let days = [1, 4, 6, 7, 8, 20]
let costs = [2, 7, 15]

Here it is profitable:
    - buy a 7-day ticket for day 6 (covers 6, 7, 8);
    - buy a 1-day ticket for day 1 and for day 4;
    - buy a 1-day ticket for 20.

Minimum cost: 2 (for 1) + 2 (for 4) + 7 (for 6‚Äì8) + 2 (for 20) = 13.

üìä Complexity:
Time: O(365) ‚Äî we go through a maximum of 365 days.

Memory: O(365) ‚Äî dp array.

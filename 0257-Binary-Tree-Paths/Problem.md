# 0257. Binary Tree Paths

## Description

Given the root of a binary tree, return all root-to-leaf paths in any order.

A leaf is a node with no children.

## Example

**Input:**
root = [1,2,3,null,5]
<br>
**Output:**
<br>
["1->2->5","1->3"]
<br>

## Constraints

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 100].`
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`

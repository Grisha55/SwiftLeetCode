# 0673. Number of Longest Increasing Subsequence

## Description

Given an integer array `nums`, return the number of longest increasing subsequences.

**Notice** that the sequence has to be **strictly** increasing

## Example

**Input:**  
nums = [1,3,5,4,7]
<br>
**Output:**
<br>
2
<br>
**Explanation:**
<br>
The two longest increasing subsequences are [1, 3, 4, 7] and [1, 3, 5, 7].

## Constraints

- `1 <= nums.length <= 2000`
- `-10^6 <= nums[i] <= 10^6`
- The answer is guaranteed to fit inside a 32-bit integer.
